# RunC
This repository contains the sublime-build file to run Java Programs on Sublime Text.

Warning: I have used the TinyCCompiler to execute C programs owing to its high performance and small size. The path of your respective compiler must be added in the System Environment variables.

To make use of this, 
STEP 1: Kindly copy the contents of RunC.sublime-build file. 
STEP 2: Go to Tools > Build System > New Build System and paste the contents.
STEP 3: Save the file. 
STEP 4: Go to Tools > Build System and select the build you just created. 
STEP 5: Use Ctrl + B to compile C programs.
